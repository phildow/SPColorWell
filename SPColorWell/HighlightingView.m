/* This view groups the contents of one suggestion.  It should be exposed to accessibility, and should report itself with the role 'AXGroup'.  Because this is an NSView subclass, most of the basic accessibility behavior (accessibility parent, children, size, position, window, and more) is inherited from NSView.  Note that even the role description attribute will update accordingly and its behavior does not need to be overridden.
